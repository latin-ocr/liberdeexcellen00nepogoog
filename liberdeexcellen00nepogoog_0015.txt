arena 01 political strife. He paid no grem attention to philosophy,
partly because his mind was by nature averse 10 metaphysica,
partly, as he says in a fragment which we have 01 0 101101 to Cicero
(Lactant. 100111. Dicin. iii. 11, 10), because he was disgusted with
the want of consisteuoy between the precepta and the practica 01
many teaohers 01 ethlcal philosophy. In historieal researches,
however, he delighted3 and it was to historical writing, particu-
larly biography, that, as an author, he chiefly gave his 0110011011.
One 01 his works was entitled Chronica, and appears to have been
an epitome 01 universal history. It consisted 01 three books, which
the poet Catullus calls, more from courtesy perhaps than sincerity‚
chartae doctae et 1010110000. In this productim, he treated of the

· ’ mythical age at considerable length. Another of his works bore

the name of Exempla, and was probably 0 history of manners and
morals, especially among the Romans. It consisted 01 at least five
books, since A. Gellius, a writer 01 the second century after Christ,
quotes 0 passage from the fifth book (vii. 18, 11.) Such a work
00 this must have afforded Nepos frequent opportunities 101 that
moral disquisition, that praise 01 the noble and the good, aud
condemnation 01 the mean and wicked, in which he 00 much
delighted. At the request 0111111000, as Nepos himself tells us
(Gaio, 3, end), he wrote adetailed life of Cato the Gensor; and we

010001 0 biography 01 Cicero. It seems not unlikely that he
composed, besides, a treatise on geography, and occasionally wrote
poetry. But 01 011 these, either nothing remains, or only a few
small fragments, which barely convey an idea 01 the nature 01
the works 01 which they formed parts. Tha most ambitious 01

distinguished men 01 011 natione and ages, but mora especially
Greeks and Romans. The lives were divided into books, each 01
which embraced a particular class 01 eminent men( 01 these
books there were at least sixteen, since Charisius, 0 grammarian
01 the fourth or fifth century 01101 Christ, refers to the sixteenth
