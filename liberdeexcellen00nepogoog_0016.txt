aive work, we posses the book Do Eceeltratihm Ducibus Exteroram
Gustum complete, along with the lives of Cato and Atticus from
the book Do Historiam Latiare, and a few fragments. The book
Do Eacattmtibae Ducibus Exteroram Gentium contains lives of
eighteen Greek generals, one Thracian, one Persian, and two
Carthaginians, along with avery brief account of some of the
most eminent monarche. The period of time comprehended
extends from the Persian invasione of Greece, in the beginning of
the fifth century a. o., to the death of Hannibal, in the beginning
of the second century mo. Some eminent Greek'commanders‚
who flourished during this period, are not mentioned by Nepos,
but, upon the whole, his list is satisfactory. The order of the
lives is not strictly chronological; but the deviatione are not of
much importante.

In judging of the valae of the work, and of the character of
Nepos as a historian, we must bear in mind that his priucipal
object in the Vitae Itlaatro‘am Virorum, as well as the Exempla,
was iu all probability tc convey moral instruction to his
countrymen. He had it in view, not so much io describe the
exploits of his heroes with minute accuracy, as to depict their
virtues or their vices, and impress his readers with a feeling of
moral approbation or disapprobation accordingly. Keeping thie
chief object of Nepos iu mind, we can account for and excuse
varicus things in the work, which, jndged hythe standard that
we commonly apply to a treatise on any historica] subject, must be
prouohnced deoided blemishes. For example, we can thus excuse
hia occasionally stating incidente in a person’s life, not in chrono-
logical order, but simply as they occurred to his memory; his
narration of anecdotes somewhat beneath the dignity of ordinary
history, but lllnstrative of traits of character3 and his almost
entire neglect, in a few cases, of historica] detail, for the sake of
dwelling upon moral· features. The most lenient critic, however,
cannot venture to defend gross inaccuracy in regard to historica]
statemeuts which we not unfrequently find in N epos. Our author
seems to have been totally unable to weigh the respective trust-
werthiness of conflicting accounts, and in some instances, where
such presented themselves in his authorities, he attempts to
reconcile them, in a simple-minded bnt utterly anphilosophical
manner, by throwing the various stories into one, which is, of
course, inconsistent aud unsatisfactory. So great is the careless-
ness oi Nepos throughout, that in the life of Datames, which he
has related more fully than any other ancient writer, and iu
regard to which, therefore, we can but seldom consult a more
trustworthy historiari, we are unable to repose implicit belief in
his testimony. We may believe in the accuracy of the general
outlines, but cannot free ourselves oi the conviction‚ that in the
details thero arc probably not a few mistakcs. Whethcr this
inaccuracy arose from natural indolence, and indisposition to
cereful reeearch, cr from haste iu the compositiones the work, it
