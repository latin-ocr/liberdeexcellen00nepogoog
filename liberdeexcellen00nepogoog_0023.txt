arena of politioal scrire. He paid no great attention to philosophy,
partly because his mind was by nature averse to metaphysics,
partly, as he says in a fragment which we have oi a letter to Cicero
(Laetant. [notit. Dicin. iii. 15,10), because he was disgusted with
the wantos consistenoy between the precepts and the practice ot'
many toachers of ethical philosophy. In historical researches,
however, he delighted3 and ic was to historical writing, partiou-
larly biography, that, as an author, he chiefly gave his attention.
One of his works vvas entitled Chronica, and appears to have been
an epitome of universal history. It consisted of three books, which
the poet Catullus calls, more from courtesy perhaps than sincerity,
chartae doctae et laboriosae. In this productiori, he treated os the
mythical ago at considerable length. Another of his works bore
the name of ,Exempla and was probably a history of manners and
morals, especially among the Romans. It consisted oi at least five
books, since A. Gellius, awriter of the second century atter Ghrist,
quotes a passage from the fifth book (vii. 18, 11.) Such a work
as this must havs afforded Nepos frequent opportunities for that
moral disquisition, that praise of the noble and the good, and
condemnation of the mean and wichad, in which he so much
delighted. At the request of Atticus, as Nepos himself tells us
(Cato, 3, end), he wrote a detailed lise of Gato the Censor; and vvs
gather from a passage in Gellius (xv. 28), that he was the author
also of a biography of Cicero. It seems not unlikely that he
eomposed, besides, a treatise on geography, and occasionally wrote
postry. But of all these, either nothing remains, or only a few
small fragments, which barely convey an idea oi the nature ot'
the works of which they formed parts. The most ambitious oi
the literary productions of our author, and the only one of which
a large portion has been preserved, is that entitled De Viris Illas·
tribas. His plan was to give a brief biographical sketch ol the most
distinguished menos all nations and ages, but more especially
Greeks and Romans. 'l'he lives vvere divided into books, each oi
which embraced a particular class ot' eminent men. Oi these
books there were at least sixteen, since Charisius, a grammarian
of the fourth or fifth century after Christ, refers to the sixteenth
(p. 113, ed. Putsoh.) Several of the titles oi the different categorias
are known—namely, De Excellentihas Imperaton'das, De Historias,
De Regibus, De Patris, and De Grammaticis. For each of those
classes or categories there were probably—in regard to some we
know it—two books, the one containing the lives of Romans, the
other those oi Greeks or other foreigners.¹ Of this comprehen-
