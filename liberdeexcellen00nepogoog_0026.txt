view ure the following: first, the purity of the style oi the work,
which seems to ntump it as belonging to c much earlier period
then the time oi Probus, for the productione of the later empire
ere turgid end bombastic‚ and disfigured by uncouth words
and phrases and unclassicol constructions; secondly, the great
resemblance—extending even to the use oi peculiar illogical
expressions, such as resecuit alicui io opinionem for opinio venit io
mentem (Mitt. 7, und liiiio. 9)-between the style of the book De
Eeeeiieoiibm Ducibus and that of the lives of Ceto and Atticus,
which the manuscripts, without variation, ascribe to Nepos;
ilrirdly‚ the fact thet the Atticus to whom the Praefatio is
addressed cen scarcely be any one else than Τ. Pomponius
Atticus, the friend of Cicero and Nepos3 fourthly, the fearless
denunciatione of despotic power contained in the work, which
could never have proceeded from e writer living in the slavery
end debasement of the later empire3 and, lastly the indicatione
oecurring frequently in the book, and commenciug even in the
Praefatio with the expression oiapottodo voluminis, which is quite
inapplicable to the little treotise extant, thet it was but a pert
of clergo and comprehensive work on ‘illustrious men,’ such
as we know was composed by Cornelius Nepos.¹ 'l'he error
in regerd to the authorship appears to have originated thus: To
the end of some old manuscript of the book De Excellentibus
Ducibus Exterorum Gentium, a cop)⁷ of rather doggrel Latin verses
was by mistake appended‚ in which Probus dedicntes e collection
oi poems (earmina) to the Emperor Theodosius. These iimcc,
carelessly examined‚ appeared to eloim for the writer the author-
ship of the work with which chance had connected them, though
the term carmine sufficiently proves the inucouracy of the notion;
and subsequent copyists, under this misopprehension‚ bansierred
theverses to' their manuscripts, and gave the work the superscrip-
tion os Aemilii Probi.

¹ Nipperdey save, that ‘ if the robeble opinion (brought forwerd by Gliser ln
the Rheiniscbes luuram for 18433 thet the liber Memmiulie of Lucius Amrrehus,
ln which the book Demaenetus Ducibus merorem Gentium has been lergely
made use oi, wss composod before the time of Diocletien (nn. 284-305), were
incontestebly certain‚' his refutetion of the clsims of Probus might have been
much brieter. While fully believing in the prior existence of the book De Επεὶ,
umato Decime, we are uneble to agree in this remark. In a somewhnt coretul
examinationes Ampelius‚we heve found the discrepancies ln uetass between
him end Nepos so' numerous, thet we think his having consultet the latter

improbable.
