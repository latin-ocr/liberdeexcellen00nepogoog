is greatly to be regretted. In forming his opiniones the character
of his heroes, Nepos is too one-sided. They are either models of
excellence, or specimeus ef numitigated baseness3 and Dion is
perhaps the only ene in this werkin whom he sees a mixture of
good and evil. Iu style, our author is generally simple. He
leves short, clear sentences, though occasionally, for the sake of
effect, he expande his thought inte a round rhetorical period. In
construction, he is commonly pure; but there are afew cases—sor
instance, condebito, followed by the accusative with the infinitiva,
instead of qaia (see Praefatio, p. l, n. 1), aud naam eat, ut (Hane. 1,
beginning)-in which he varies from the ordinary mode of
expression in good writers. Anaeoluths—that is, sentences which
end in a manner unsuitable to their commencement, and the
different parts of which are therefore inconsistent in construction
-are of very frequent occurrence, and prove that the author’s
carelessness in regard to research extended also to composition.
In his choice ef single words, likewise, Nepos is generally quite
classical, but occasionally we meet with words of a colloquial
kind, unsuitable for serious writing, ond admitted probably
through inadvertence. Such are impraesentiarum (Horta. 6),
exadversus and enadoeraum (Phraeyh. 2, end, and Themist. 3, end),
and others. As was to be expected in a book treating principelly
of Greeks, and iu the compositiones which the author must
coustanlly heve had Greek authorities before him, there are
numerous Graecisms in the forms of declension, and sometimes
in the words. Thus, fer example, we have Marathona (Mil. il,
Salamina aud fhoerena (Thamiai. 2, end), trieris fer triremis
(aare. 4), aud citharizare (Epam. 2, beginning.) Nepos's careless-
ness in composition appears not merely in broken constructions‚
as was mentioned above, but also in the disagreeable repetition
of the same words, where a change in the expression was quite
practicable, without iujury to the sense. This occurs very fre-
quently, and seme of the most offensive cases are pointed out in
the Notes. But though Nepos een by no means be placed, either
in regard to substance or style, among writers of the first class,
yet the eminently virtuous spirit which pervades his work, and
the interesting nature ef much that it contains, account for, and
in a measure justify, the position which it has almost universally
obtained in educatiou.

In the manuscripts, the book De Excellentihes Ducibus Exteroram
Gentiana is ascribed not to’Nepoa but te a certain Aemilius
Probus, who lived in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius 1.
(Λ. a. 879-395.) After the invention ef printing, the work passed
through a considerable number cf editions, with the neme of this
person as the author3 until Dionysius Lambinus, a scholar oi
great eminence‚ in an edition which he published in the year
1569, propounded the opinion, that the author was not Probus, but
Cornelius N epos-an opinion which has approved itself at rho great
maierity of competent jndges The principal arguments for this
