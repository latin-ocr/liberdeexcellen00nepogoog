me, vellemne secum in castra proficisci. ld cum libenter
accepissem, atque ab eo petere coepissem. ne dubitaret ducere,
turn ille “Faciam'’ inquit, “si mihi fidem, quam postulo,
dederis.’‘ Simul me ad aram adduxit, apud quam sacrificare
instituerat, eamque, ceteris remotis tenentem 'urare jussit,
nunquam me in amicitia cum Romanis fore. d ego jusju-
randum patri datum traque ad hanc aetatem ita conservavi,

⁴ Aeto this mode ofexpreasion, see De Reg. 2, p. 169, n. 4. Tha
ablativa annia rs used instead of the accusative annos, because the
substantive is very irregulnrly thrown immediately under the govern-
ment of the comparatrve minor, leaving antus in a manner quita
unconnected. There is a similar case in Cicero. Nepos erra in
stating that Hannibal was at this time under twenty-five: he was in
bis twenty-sixrh year.

⁸ Saguntum (now Murviedro, acorrnprion of mari veteres), a town
situated south of the Ebro. and not iar from thesea. Foederatam,
‘allied,' namely, with the Romans. The feeling of Nepos as a Ro·
man was, that Saguntum was allied ‘with us ;’ and, this being well
known to his countrymen, sor whom, in the first instance, he was ·
writing, he does not consider it necessary to state the fact tirlly.
Civitas must not ba taken here as exactly equivalent to urbs, for this
is a use of the word almost exclusively confined to later Latinit .
The distinction is this: urbs is ‘acity,' viewed in regard to its build-
in a, alarga collection of houses; civitas is ‘a city,’ viewed politi·
cally, in regard to its institutions, u larga bodyof men living to ether
under the same Ιεονεττττττεττῑ, ‘a atate.' Hence it is evident nitar an
urbs, in the strrct senae, could not be foederato, for rt is the inha-
bitants, not the buildin s, that are allied. We must not prcss too
strin ently the fact, tdat civitatem is in apposition to Saguntum,
wirici¹ is governed by eaprrgnovit, a verb clearly referring to tha
buddmgra but must take foederatam civitatem aa uuita equivalenttc
