(216 n. o), principally by the instigation os his iavonrite, Demetrius
of Pharos. The influenoe os Hannibal in the matter appears to have
consisted merelp in the success os his arms.

¹ Antiochus I Ι.. king ol Syria, surnamed the Great, reigned srom
223 to 187 n. c. Nom, at the beginning of this sentence, is obviously
intended to introduce a proos or illustration os the statement made in
the end of the preceding chapter, that Hannibal never ceased, even
in his adversity, to cherish feelings os hatred against the Romans.
Consequently, instead os Nom-omniunt —potentissimustree Anti·
ocnassan: hunc-incendit, cet, the logical mode os speakrng would
be, to throw the two sentences into one, Nam-Antiochum, qui ona·
niam potentissimus ren fnit, tanta cupiditate incendit bellandi, cet.
Nepos, however, desirous to simplily the construction, divides the
period, making what is in reality a merc accessory and parenthetical
observation (qni-fnit) into a sentence by itsels, forgetting that the
nona is in no way applicable to it.

³ Tam uam ab ipsis corruptam belong closel to Hannibalem,
though they are somewhat awkwardly separated rom it. The order
of construction, therefore, is this: ut adducerent Hannibalem, tam·
qnam ab ipsis corruptum (thetis, quem ab ipsis corruptum ease timulo·
rent), re t' in suspicionem (etam) sentire alia atque antea'(‘ was enter-
taining different sentimenta-with regard to the Romans-from
those which he had formerly avowed.’) Adducere aliquem alicui in
suspicionem, is ‘to bring one into suspicion with another,¹ ‘to make
one be sus ected by another.’ One means adopted by the arnbassa-
dors sore eoting their end, was to visit and converse with Hannibal
osten, thus leading the king to think that his old hostility to their
⁴ nation had in some way been removed.
