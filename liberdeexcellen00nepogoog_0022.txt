INTRODUOTION

Vnar little is known of the personal history ot* Cornelius Nepos,
and tho few facts with which we ars acquainted, have been
gether-ed rather by insereres, than from actual statemeuts in
ancient writers. In his life of Atticus (19), he speaks of his
having survived Atticus as a special dispensation of fortune.
From this, as well as from the great intimacy which existed be-
tween the two—an intimacy of a kind scarcely consistent with
any grem disparity of age-wo m'ay conclude that Nepos was
born about the same time es Atticus-109 ao. His native
district was that part of Cisalpine Gaul which the Insubrians
inhabited, beyond the Po. Hc removed to Rome in earlyhie, and
in all hkelihood made that city his principal place of residence
till his daath, content with a small competenoe, spending his time
to a great extent in literary pu'rsuits‚ in the society of literary
friends, and, both from prudenoe and his natural love of peace
and tranquillity, keeping himself entirely unconnected with the
politicalmovemeutsof thatstirringandeuentfulepoch. We gether
from a remark in oue ot* Cicero’s letters to Atticus (xvi. 14, 4),
that Nepos lost a child by death about the year 44 a. c., when he
must have been considerably advanced in liro. llis most intimate
friends seem to have been Atticus, who was undoubtedly a man
of very great learning, taste, amiability, and virtue, though the
sketch of his character by Nepos is drawn with the pen of an
idolator rather than an admirer; cicero, tho most eminent philos·
opher oud orator that Rome ever produced; and Catullus, apost
of very high genius, who dedicated his collected poema to our
author. The exact period of the death of Nepos is uncertain.
We know that the latter part of tho life of Atticus was written in
or after the year 29 aa, because in chapter 19, Octavianus is
styled imperator, which title was not conferred on him till thet
year; and it is probable‚ considering Nepos’s advanced age, that
he died shortly after. His character may be very easily seen
from his writings, Hs was a man of high moral excellence, and
henos in his biographies he constautly strives to bring the virtues
of his heroes into prominent view, considering their exploits in
‚ war as but of secondary interest. His moral observations are
almost always just, and osten very beautiful. In intellectual
power he was merely respectable, not eminent; and e conscious·
