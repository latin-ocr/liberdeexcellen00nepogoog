1. Truonnou Corinthius. Sine dubio¹ magnus omnium
judicio hic vir extitit. Namque· huic uni contigit, quod
nescio an nulli,¹ ut et patriam, inqua erat natus, oppressam
a tyranno liberaret, et a Syracusis, quibus auxilio erat missus,
jam inveteratam³ servitutem depelleret, totamque Siciliam,
multos annos bello vexatam a barbarisque⁴ oppressam, suo
adventu in pristinum restitueret.⁶ Sed in his rebus non sim·
plici fortuua⁶ condictatus est, et, id quod difficilius putatur,
multo sapientius tulit secundam quarn adversam fortunam.
Nam curn frater ejus Timophanes, dux a Corinthiis delectus,⁷
tyrannidem per milites mercenarios occupasset, particepsque
regni posset⁸ esse, tanturn afuit a societate sceleris, ut ante-
tulerit civium suorum libertatem, fratris saluti, et parere

¹ Siue dubio belongs to maguus, ‘undoubtedly great!

'² Tho expression necere aa, ‘I know not whether,’ is here, as very
often, used adverbially, with the sense ul ‘ perhaps! This accounts
for the use of nulli; for, if we look at the strict meaning of the words,
ulli should follow. But nescio un has so completely assumed the
force of a modest affirmative, that in cases lilre this, where the mean·
ing is intended to be negative, a negative follows. Patrium, iu quc
eret nctus.- this is obviously an uhsurd tautology. The author treats
patric us if it were simply equivalent to terra or urbs.

'See Dion, ⁵, p. 89, n. 8.
‘That is, the Carthaginiens, who had settlements in Sicily.

⁸ ‘Restored to its original condition! We·may either supply
atatam, or which is better, consider pristinum as the neuter used
substantively. In integram restituere is similarly used.

'Simpleepcrtunc is ‘a fate or fortune of one kind,' either con-
stantly goe ur constantly bad. Fortuna uon simplae is therefore
‘various fortunas,’ ‘a chennered fate ;’ and in the use uf the verb
ponflirtcrr', the authoris obviously thinking particularly of adversa
ortana.
