PRENAOE.

Ir is not necessary here to defend theuso oi' Nepo‘s as a school·
book. Much may be said both for and against it3 but thare can
he no doubt that, considering how universally the work is em.
ployed in education, a classical series such as the present would
hare appeared imperfect had it not included an edition oi Nepos.
The text here given is based upon that of Dr. Karl Nipperdey, as
giren in his school edition (Leipzig: 1849„ which text is gene· ¹
rally considered by scholars as the best that has yet appeared.
The texts of Bremi (3d edition; Ziirich: 1820) and Taschuche
(Gdttingenz 1804) hare, however, been carefully compared, and
their readings, where they differed from Nipperdey, occasionally ἱ
adopted. A valuable review by Hartmann cf the school editions
of Nipperdey and Siebelis‚ contained in the Zeitaclrafl fiir die
Altcrltumswisacnacloft for 1851, has also been consulted in the
formation of the text. The fragments of several worhs of Nepos,
which have been collected from ancient writers, are not included
in this edition, because their brevity, unconnectedness‚ and un·
' satisfactory character, render them quite unsuitable for a school·
book.

The notes are chiefly historical and grammatical,and in the
carly part oi the hook are more numerous than afterwards3 it
being believed that at the stage in the young student’s progress,
when Nepos is put into his hands, he· might stumble even at some
of the minor difficulties of the language. Bytho time, however,
that he has advancad as far as the twelfth or thirteenth Life, ha

may be preeuned to bewcll initiated into the style ot ἱλεζκκκὶκπη,
