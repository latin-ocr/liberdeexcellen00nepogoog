Cum tanta pecuniae facta esset accessio,² nihil de quotidiano
cultu mutavit, nihil de vitae consuetudine; tantaque usus est

acceperat, parurn se splendide gesserit, neque in sestertio

¹ ‘Invited,‘ as often.
² When he received his uncle's property: eea chapter 5, beginning.

⁸⁴1n his two millions ol sestercea;’ that is, ‘when he had two
milliens ol sesterces! Sestertio here is the ablativo os sestertium,
properly the genitive plural ol sertertium, but which, being constantly
employed in monetary calculation, as guverned by mille (used sub·
stontively) or milio, came at last to be considered as a neuter noun,
meaning ‘a thousand sestertii,’ and to be declined. Thraeciaque
sestertia was said sor quiaque milio sestertium. In such a case as tha
present, however, where a numeral adverb is used, and where, had
the genitive form sestertium been employed, we should have had
to supply centenis milibus (see chapter 5, p. 197, n. 11 ,) we must con-
sider sestertium to represent not a thousand but a hundred thousand.

⁴ ‘ Stoa? {rr} an equal emineuce,’ in regard to dignified conduct aud

'Arretium (now Arezzo) was an ancient town in the east of·
Etruria. Nomentum (now Mentesa) was a town in the country of
the Subines, not far from Rome.

seller (for the pareri litteratissimi spoken os m chapter 13 were em·
ployed in transcribing boolts lorthe public ae well as for their master),
and in other capacities. The truth is, that Atticus neglected no
meane os making money.
