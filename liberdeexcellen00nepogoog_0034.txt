aive work, we possse the book Da Excellectibce Ducibru aerearum
Gentium complete, along with the lives of Cato aad Atticus from
the book De Haterius Latinis, and a few fragments. The book
De Excellenta'tue Ducibus Extercrrtm Gentium contains lives of
eighteen Greek generals, one Thracian, one Persian, and two
Carthaginiens‚ along with avery brief account of some of the
most eminent monarcha. The period of time comprehended
extends from the Persian invasione of (iresca, in the beginning of
the fifth century a. c.‚ to the death of Hannibal, in the beginning
of the second century a. o. Some eminent Greek'commanders,
who flourished during this period, are not mentioned by Nepos,
but, upon the whole, bis list is satisfactory. The order of the
lives is not strictly chronologica13 but thc deviatione arc not of
much importante.

In judging of the value of the work, and of the character of
Nepos as a bisterton, wo must bear in mind that his principal
object in the Vitae Illustrium Virorum, ae well as the Exemplo,
was in all probability to convey moral instruction to his
countrymen. He had it in view, not so much to describe the
explcits of his heroes with minute accuracy, as to depict their
virtues or their vices, and impress his readers with a feeling of
moral approbation or discpprobation accordingly. Kceping this
chief object of Nepos in mind, we can account for and excuss
various things in the work, which, jndged by the standard that
we commonly apply to a treatiee on anyhistorical subject, must be
pronohnced decided blemishes. For example, we can thus excuse
his occasionally stating incidente in a person’s life, not in chrono-
logical order, bnt simply as they occurred to his memory; his
namohon of anecdotos eomewhat bencath the dignity of ordinary
history, bnt illustrativs of traits of character3 and his almost
entire neglect, in a few casse, of historical detail, for the sake of
dwelling upon moral features. The most lenient critic, however,
cannot venture to defend grose inaccuracy in regard to historica]
statements, which we nct unfreqnentlyfind in Nepos. Our author
seems to have been totally unable to weigh the respective trust·
worthiness of conflicting accounts; and in some instances, where
ench presented themselves in his authorities, he attempts to
reconcile them, in a simple-minded but utterly unphilosophical
manner, by throwing the various stories into one, which is, of
course, inconsistent and unsatisfactory. So great is the careless-
ness cf Nepos throughout, that in the life of Datames, which he
hae related more fully than any other ancient writer, and in
regard to which, therefore, we can but seldom consult a more
trustworthy historica, we are unable to reposo implicit belief ln
his testimony. We may believe in the accuracy of the general
outlince, bnt cannot free ourselves of the conviction‚ that in the
details there ore probably aot a few mistahcs. ththor this

inaccuracy arose from natural indolence, and indisposition to
careful research, or from haste ln the composition of the workh
