aive work, we posses the book De Errelhatitm Dacibm Eatercram
Gerticos complete, along with the lives of Cato and Atticus from
the book De Historias Latina, and a few fragments. The book
De decedentibus Ducibus Exterarram Gentium contains lives oi
eighteen Greek generals, one Thracian, one Persian, and two
Carthaginiens, along with every brief account of some of the
most eminent monarcha. The period of time comprehended
extends from the Persian invasione of Graece, in the beginning οι
the fifth century n. ο., ιο the death of Hannibal, in the beginning
of the second century n. ο. Some eminent Greelr'oommanders,
who flourished during this period, are not mentioned by Nepos,
but, upon the whole, his listis satisfactory. The order of the
lives is not strictly chronological; but the deviatione arc not of
mach importanee.

In judging of the value of the work, and os the character of
Nepos ae a historiari, we must bear in mind that his principal
object in the Vitae Illastriam Virorum, as well as the Exempla,
was in all probabihty to convey moral instruction to his
countrymen. lle had it iu view, not so much ιο describe tho
exploits oi his heroes with minute accuraoy, as to depict their
virtues or their vices, and impress his readers with a feeling ot’
moral approbation or disapprobatian accordingly. Keeping this
chief object of Nepos in mind, ve can account ior and excuse
various things in the work, which, judged by the standard that
we commonly apply ιο a treatise on any historical subject, must be
pronoirnoed decidod blemishes. For example, we can thus excuse
his occasionally stating incidente in a person’s life, not in chrono-
logical order, bat simply as they occurred to his memory; his
narraticn of anecdotes somewhat beueath the dignity of ordinary
history, but illustrative of traite of character, and his almost
entire neglect, in a few cases, of historioal detail, scr tha sake of
dwelling upon moral features. The most lenient critic, however,
cannot venture to defend gross inaccuracy in regard to historica]
statemeuts, which we not unfrequentlyfind in Nepos. Our author
seems to have been totally unable to weigh the respective trust-
worthiness of conflicting accounts; and in soma instances, where
such presented themselves in his authorities, he attempta to
reconcile them, in a simple-minded but utterly unphilosophical
manner, by throwing the various storias into one, which is, of
course, inconsistent and unsatisfactory. So great is the careless-
ness of Nepos throughout, that in the life of Datames, which he
has related more sully than any other ancient writer, and iu
regard to which, therefore, we ean but seldom consult a more
trustworthy historiae, we are unable to repose implicit belief in
his testimony. We may believe in the accuracy ol the general
outlines, but cannot free ourselves ot the conviction, that in the
details there are probably not a few mistakes. Whether this
inaccuracy arose from natural indolence, and indisposition to
careful research, or from haste iu the composition of the work, ie
