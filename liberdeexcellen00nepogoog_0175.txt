¹ Cum-pervenisset, pervenit. Awkward repetitions os the sams
word occur often in Nepos. Prospera fortuna, ‘with prosperans sor·
tune,’ ¹ with the favour os fortune.¹

² Alter prima quad, we expect deinde or postea qaodr but the second
cause ol' hatred ts introduced at Concidit actem in a distinct sentence.
Demades was an Athenian orator of reat ahility but no principle.
In 322 a. c. Antipater, the regent ol acedonia, defeated the con·
foderata Greeks at Cranen. in Thessaly, and Demades, Phocion, and
some others. were sent by the Atheniens to treat with the conqueror.
They agreed among other things, not, as Nepos says, to surrender
the city, but ro receive aMacedonian garrison into the port ol Muny-
chia, a condition which Phocion strove, but in vain, to induce Anti·
pater to dispense with. Hereupon Demosthenes (the greatest orator
and one os the noblest men of antiquit ), and the other leaders of the
anti·Macedonian party in Athens. tooit to ssight, and upon the pro·
posal of Demades, tha people sentenced them to death. From this
sltetch one or two errors in Nepos’s statement may be perceived.

³These words are emphatic, as their position shows: ‘it was by
the support and aid of Demosthenes that he had mounted to that

· position which he occupied! Aregere aliquem is ‘to promote a per·

son, obtain sothim honour and influence.’

⁴ The subject of subornaret is Demosthenes, and eam refers to Pho·
cion. This change ol the subject is awhtvard, but there are other
instances oi the same kind in Nepos. Ar to Chares, see Chabrias, 3,
p. 101, n. 7. Saboraere is strictly ‘to furnish seeretly‚’ aforce which
sab sometimes has in composition. Here we must understand tha

Demosthenes, and had acquired some reputation before the latter
entered public tite. Moreover, Demosthenes and Chares, instead
ol being enemies, were politically allied, notwithstanding the con·
