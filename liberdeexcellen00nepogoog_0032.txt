INTRODUGTION

Vsnv little is known of the perronal history of Cornelius Nepos,
and the few facts with which we are acquainted have been
gathered rather by inferente, than from actual statemeuts in
ancient writers. In his life of Atticus (19), he speaks of his
having survived Atticus as 1 special dispensation of fortune.
From this, as well as from the great intimacy which existed be·
twcen the two-an intimacy of a kind scarcely consistent with
any great disparity of age-we m'ay conclude that Nepos was
born about the same time as Atticus-109 ac. His native
district was that part of Cisalpine Gaul which the Insubrians
inhabited, beyond the Po. He removed to Rome in early life, and
in all likelihood made that city his principal place of residence
till his death, content with a small competence, spending his time
to a great extent in literary pursuits, in the society of literary
friends, and, both from prudence and his natural love of peace
and tranquillity, keeping himself entirely unconnected with the
politioal movements of that stirring and eventful epooh. We gather
from 1 remark in one of Cicero’s letters to Atticus (xvi. 14, 4),
that Nepos lost a child by death about the year 44 a. 1., when he
must have been considerablyadvanoed in life. iiis most intimate
friends seem to have been Atticus, who was undoubtedly a man
cf very great learning, taste, amiability, and virtue, though the
sketch of his character by Nepos is drawn with the pen of an
idolator rather than an admirer; Cicero, the most eminent philos-
opher and orator that Rome ever produced; and Catullus, a poet
of very high genius, who dedicated his collected poems to cur
author. The exact period of the death of Nepos is uncertain.
We know that the latter part of the life oi Atticus was written in
or after the year 29 aa, because in chapter 19, Octavianus is
styled imperator, which title was not conferred on him till that
year; and it is probable, considering Nepos's advanced age, that
he died shortly after. His character may be very easily seen
from his writings‚ He was a man of high moral excellence, and
hence inhia biographies he constantly strives to bring the virtues
of his heroes into prominent view, considering their exploits in
, war as but of secandary interest. His moral observations are
almost always just, and often very beautiful. In intellectual
power he was merely respectable, not eminent; and a conscious-
