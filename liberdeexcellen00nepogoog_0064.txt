tightly round their staff iri a spiral form. and wrote their orders upon
it. When the leather was talten off, nothing could bo seen but single
letters or syllables. It was taken io the general. who rolled it upon
his staff, when tho words appeared again in intelligible order. the
word σκυτάλη, roperly. ‘a staff,’ comes naturally enough lrom the

Pausanias had a σκυτάλη at this time, seeing that he had returned to
the army without command3 but the probability is, that he had not
