propter suam gratiam et Caesaris potentiam nullius con-
ditionis³ non haberet potestatem, potissimum ejus deligeret
affinitatem, praeoptaretque equitis Romam filiam generos·
arum⁴ nuptiis. Atque harum nuptiarum conciliator fuit
(non est euim celandum)⁵ M. Antonius, triumvir reipublicae.⁶
Cujus gratia cuni augere possessiones posset suas, tanturn
afuit a cupiditate pecuniae, ut nulla in re usus sit ea, nisi
in deprecandis amicornm aut periculis aut incommodis
Quod quidem sub ipsa proscriptione perillustre fuir. Nam

annos, studio ductus philosophiae, habitabat Athenis,
habebatque in ltalia pretiosas possessiones, triumviri bona
vendidissent, consuetudine ea qda tum res gerebantur,
Attici labore atque industria factum est, ut eodem nuncio
Saufeius fieret certior se patrimonium amisisse et recuperasse.

place which Nepos awards him among the poets of his age, we must
remember that, ar the tirne thia was written (probablyabout 35 or 34
