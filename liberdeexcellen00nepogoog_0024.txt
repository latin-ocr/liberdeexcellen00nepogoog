sive work, we posses the book Dc Excellentibur Βυοίιιιι Balarorum
θοηιιιιοι complete, along with tha lives o'f Cato and Atticus from
the backDeHistoricis Latinis, and a few fragments. The book
De Excellentibm Duoibta Balarorum Gentium contains lives cf
eighteen Greek generals, one Thracian, one Persian, aud two
Carthaginians, along with avary brief account of some cf tha
most eminent monarcha. The period of time comprehended
extends from the Persian invasione cf Greece, in the beginning cf
the fifth century a. ο., ιο the death of Hannibal, in the beginning
of the second century ιι. ο. Some eminent Greek'commanders,
who flcurished during this period, are not mentioned by Nepos,
but, upon the whole, his list is satisfactory. The order of the
lives is not strictly chronological; but the deviatione arc not of
much importanca.

In judging of the velue of the work, and of the character of
Nep os as a historiar, we must bear ιιι mind thet his principal
obj actm the Vitae Illaatrium Virorum, as well as the Exemplo,

was in cll probability ιο convey moral instruction to his
muntrymeu. lie had itm view, not sc much ιο describe the
exploits of his herces with minute accuracy, as to depict their
virtues or their vices, aud impress his readers with a feeling cf
moral approbation or disapprobation accordingly. Keeping this
chief object of Nepos in mind, wc can account for and excuse
rarione things in the warh, which, judged hythe standard that
we commonly apply to a trectise cn any historical subject, must be

ronohnced decided blemishes. Nor example, we canthus excuse
dis occasionally stating incidente in a persou’s life, not in chrone-
logical order, but simply as they occurred to his memory; his
namaticn of anecdotes somewhat beneath the dignity of ordinary
history, but illustrative of traits af character; and his almost
entire neglect, in a few cases, of historica] detail, for the sake of
duelling upon moral features. The most lenient critic, however,
cannot venture ιο defend grass inaccuracy in regard ιο historical
statements, which we not uufrequently find ιιι Nepos Our author
seems to have been totally unable ιο weigh the respective trust-
werthiness of conflicting accounts; and ιιι some instances, where
such presented themselves' ιιι his authorit' tres, he attempta ιο
reconcile them,' ιιι c simple· m-inded but utterly unphilosophical
manner, by throwing the varicus storias into one, which is, of
course, inconsistent and unsatisfactory. So great is the careless-
ness of Nepos throughout, that in the life of Datames, which he
has related more fully than any other ancient writer, and in
regard ιο which, therefore, wc can but seldcm consult a more
trustwcrthy historica, we are unable to repose implicit belief' ιιι
his testimony. We may believe ιιι the accuracy of the general
outlines, but cannot free ourselves of the conviction, that ln the
details ibera are probably not a few mistahes Whethcr this
inaccuracy arose from natural indolence, aud indisposition to
carelul research, or from nata ru the compositiones the werke.
