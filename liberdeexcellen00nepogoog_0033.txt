arena 01 political strife. He pald no greca attention to philosophy,
partly because his mind was by nature averse to metaphysics,
partly, as he says in a fragment which we have of a letter to Cicero
(Lactant. Iastia Dicin. iii. 15, 10), because he was diegusted with
the want of consistency between the precepts and the practice 01
many teachers of ethical philosophy. ln historical researches,
however, he delighted; and it was to historical writing, particu-
larly biography, that, as aa author, he chiefly gave his attention.
One of his works was entitled Chronica, and appears to have been
an epitome of universal history. It consisted of three books, which
the poet catullus calls, more from courtesy perhaps than sincerity,
chartae doctae at laboriosae. In this productiori, he treated of the

’ mythical age at considerable length. Another 01 his werke bore

the name 01 ,Exempla and was probably a history 01 manners and
morale, especially among the Romans. It consisted of at least five
books, since A. Gellius, awriter of the second century after Christ,
quotes a passage from the fifth book (vii. 18, 11.) Such a work
as this must have ufforded Nepos frequent opportunities for that
moral disquisition, that praise of the noble and the good, and
condemnation of the mean and wicked, in which hc so much
delighted. At the request 01 Atticus, as Nepos himself tells us
(Octo, 3, end), he wrote adetailed life 01 Cato the Censor3 and we
gether from a passage in Gellius (xv. 28), that he was the author
also 01 a biography of Cicero. It seems not unlikely that he
composed, besides, a treatise on geography, and occasionally wrote ,
poetry. Bnt of all these, either nothing remains, or only a few
small fragments, which barely convey an idea of the nature of
the works 01 which they formed parts. The most ambitious 01
the literary productione 01 our author, and the only one 01 which
alarge portion has been preserved, is that entitled De Viris Illus-
tribus. His plan was to giveabrief biographical sketch of the most
distinguished men of all nations and ages, but more especially
Greeks and Romans. The lives were divided into books, each of
which embraced a particular class of eminent men. Of these
books there were at least sixteen, since Charisius, a grammarian
of the fourth or fifth century after Christ, refers to the sixteenth
(p. maceratam.) Several of the titles of the differentcategories
are known—namely, De Excellentidcs Imperatoribua De Historias,
De Regibus, Dc Pollis, and De Grammaticis. For each 01 these
classes or categories there were probably-in regard lo some we
know it-two books, the one containing the lives of Romans, the
other those of Greeks or other foreigners.¹ Of this comprehen-
