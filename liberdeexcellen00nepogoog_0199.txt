’ bellum foret, inimicissimum nomini Romano,¹ etiamnunc
cum imperio apud exereitum haberent, itemque fratrem

ppos Magonem. Hoc responso Carthaginienses cognito¹

annibalem domurn et Magonem revocarunt Huc ut rediit,
praetor factus est,³ postquam rex fuerat anno secundo et
vicesimo. Ut enirn Romae consules sic Carthagine quotannis
annui bini reges creabantur. ln eo magistratu pari diligentia
se Hannibal praebuit, ac fuerat in bello. Namque effecit ex
novis vectigalibus, non solum ut⁴ esset pecunia, quae Romanis
ex foedere penderetur, sed etiam superesset, quae in aerario
reponeretur. Deinde anuo post praeturam, M. Claudio,
L. Furio, consulibus, Roma legati Carthaginem venerunt.
Hos Hannibal ratus sui exposcendi gratia missos, priusquam
his senatus daretur,⁶ navem ascendit clam, atque in Syriam·
ad Antiochum profugit. Hac re palam facta, Poeni naves duas,
quae eum comprehenderent, si possent consequi, miserunt, bonu
· ejus publicarunt, domum u fundamentis disjecerunt, ipsum
exulem judicarunt.

¹ That is, populo Romano. Nomen is osten thus used, particularly
where tho inhabitants os several distinct places are comprehended
under one general appellation, as in nomen latinum.

²Astto this position of the words, see Pooron 5, p. 49, n. 10.
Domum is oddly inserted between Hannibalem and et Magonem.-

three years, l'or the consulship ol M. Claudius and L. Furius, which
issaid a little below to have been in the year ulter his praetorship,
was in 196 a. c. Hannibal is suid to have been rnade metor-in the

statement is correct, we must suppose that the Carthaeinians be·
stowed u on him this honour while he was absent in Hpain, asa
proof os their perfect satisfaction with the choica that the army had

will be remambered, took place in that year.
