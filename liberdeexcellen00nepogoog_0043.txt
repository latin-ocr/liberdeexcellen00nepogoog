One of his works was entitled Chronica, and appears to have been
aa epitome of universal history. It consisted of three books, which
the poet Catullus calls, more from courtesy perhaps than sincerity,
chartae doctae et laboriosae. In this productim, he treated cf the
mythical age at considerable length. Another ot' his works bore
the name of Exempla, and was probably a history of manners and
morale, especially among the Romans. It consisted cf at least five
books, since A. Gellius, awriterof the second century after Christ,
quotes a passage from the fifth book (vii. 18, 11.) Such a work
as this must have afforded Nepos frequent opportunities for thot
moral disquisition, that praise ol the noble and the good, and
condemnation of the mean and wicked, in which he so much
delighted. At the request of Atticus, as Nepos himself tells us
(Octo, 3, end), he wrote adetailed life of (lato the Oens0r; and ve
gether from a passage in Gellius (xv. 28), that he was the author
also of a biography of Cicero. lt seems not uulikely that he
compcsed, besides, a treatise oa geography, and occasionelly wrote
poetry. But oi all these, either nothing remains, or only a few
small fragments, which barely convey an idea of the nature ct
the works of which they formed parts. The most ambitious of
the literary productioris of our author, and the only ons of which
alarge portion hasbeen preserved, is that entitled Dc Viris Illas·
tubus. His plan was to give a brief biographical sketch of the most
distinguished men of all nations aad ages, bat more especially
Greeks and Romans. The lives were divided into books, each of
which embraced a particular class of eminent men* 0f these
books there were at least sixteen, since Charisius, a grammarian
of the fourth or fifth century atter Christ, refers to the sixteenth
(p. 113, ed. Putsch.) Several of the titles of the differentcategcries
are known—namely‚ De Excellentibua Imperatoribua, De Historias,
De Regibus, Dc Portis, and De Grammaticis. For each of these
classes or categories there were probably-in regard to some we
know it- two books, the one containing the lives of Romans, the
other those of Greeks or other foreigners.¹ 0t this comprehen-
