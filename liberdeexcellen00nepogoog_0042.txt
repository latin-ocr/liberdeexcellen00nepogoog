INTRODUOTION

Vrav little is known ol the perronal history of Cornelius Nepos,
and the few facts with which we are acquainted have been
gethered rather by interanea, than from actual statemeuts in
ancient writers. ln his life of Atticus (19), he speaks of his
having survived Atticus as a special dispensaticu of fortune.
From this, as well as from the grem intimacy which existed be·
tween the tvo—an intimacy of a kind scarcely consistent with
any great disparity of age-we m'ay conclude that Nepos was
bern about the same time as Atticus-109 aa. His native
district was that part of Cisalpine Gaul which the Insubrians
inhabited, beyond the Po. He removed to Rome in early lile, and
in all likelihood made that city his principal place of residence
till his death, content with a small competenoe, spending his time
to a grem extent in literary pu'rsnits, in the society of literary
friends, and, both from prudence and his natural love ol peace
and tranquillity‚ heeping himself entirely nncennected with the
politieal movements of that stirring and eventful epoch. We gether
from a remark in one ol Cicero’s letters to Atticus (xvi. 14, 4),
that Nepos lost a child by death about the year 44 a. c.‚ when he
must have been considerably advanoed in life. His most intimate
friends seem to heve been Atticus, who was undoubtedlya man
of very great learning, taste, amiability, and virtue, though the
sketch of his character by Nepos is drawn with the pen of aa
idolater rather than an admirer; Cicero, the most eminent philos·
opher and orator that Rome ever produced; and Catullus, a poet
of very high genius, who dedicated his collected poems to our
author. The exact period ol the death of Nepos is uncertain.
We know that the latter part of the life of Atticus was written in
or after the year 29 aa, because in chapter 19, Octavianus is
styled imperator, which title was not conferred on him till thet
year3 and it is probable, considering Nepos's advanced age, that
he died shortly after. His character may be very easily seen
from his writings, He was a man of high moral excellence, and
hence in his biographies he constautly strives to bring the virtues
uf his heroes into prominent view, considering their exploits in
, wer as but of secondary interest. llis moral observatione are
almost always just, and often very beautiful. In intellectuat
power he was merely respectable, not eminent; aad a consciens-
