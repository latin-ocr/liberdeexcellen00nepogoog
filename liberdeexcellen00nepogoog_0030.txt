Phaenea.

Ir is not necessary here to defend theuso of Nepde ae a school·
bools. Much may be said both for and against it3 but there can
be no doubt that, considering how nniversally the work is em.
ployed in eddoation, a classical series such ae the present would
have appeared imperfect had it not included an edition of Nepos,
The text· here given ie based upon that of Dr. Karl Nipperdey, as
given in his school edition (Leipzig2 1849); which text ie gene-
rally considered by scholare ae the best that hae yet appeared.
The texts of Bremi (3d edition; Ziirich: 1820) and Trechuclse
(Gdttingem 1804) have, however, been carefully compared, and
their readings, where they differed from Nipperdey, occasionally .
adopted. A valuable review by Hartmann cf the school editions
ef Nipperdey and Siebelie, contained in the Zeitaohrijt fiir die
Altertbumawiasenachast for 1851, has also been consulted in the
formation of the text. The fragments of several werke of Nepos,
which hare been collected from ancient writers, are not included
in thie edition, because their brevity‚ unconnectednese, and un·
' satisfactory character, render them quite unsuitable for a school·
book.

The notes are chiefly historieal and grammaticalem in the
early part ol the book are more numerous thau afterwards3 it
being believed that at the stage in the young student’s progrees,
when Nepos ie put into hie hands, he might stumble even at some

of the minor difficulties ol the languagc. By the time, however,
that he has advaneed as far as the twelfth or thirteenth Life, he
may be presumed tc be well initiated into the style cf the aether,
