adolescens aequali familiarius quarn hoc sene, neque solum
eum principem consilii haberet, sed etiarn iu convictu.l
Excogitatum est a quibusdam, ut privatum aerarium Caesaris
interfectoribus ab equitibus Romanis constitueretur.² ld
facile effici posse arbitrati sunt, si principes ejus ordinis
pecunias contulissent. Itaque appellatus cst³ a C. Flavio,
Bruti familiari, Atticus, ut ejus rei princeps esse vellet. Ar
illc, qui officia amicis praestanda sine factione⁴ existimaret,
semperque a talibus se consiliis removisset, respondit, siquid
Brutus de suis facultatibus uti voluisset, usurum, quantum Α
hae paterentur3 se neque cum quoquam de ea re collocuturum,
neque coiturum.⁵ Sic ille consensionis globus hujus unius
dissensione disjectus est. Neque multo post‘ superior esse
coepit Αηῑοηίυε,8 ita ut Brutus et Cassius, provinciarum qnae
his dicis causa datae erant a consule⁷ . . . . ,desperatis rebus,
in exilium proficiscerentur. Atticus, qui pecuniam simul
curu ceteris conferre noluerat florenti illi parti, abjecto¹

As to aequali, see Arist. 1, p. 40, n. 1.

’ ¹ Repeat haberet merely, not principem liaberet.

⁹ ‘Thai aprivateluud should be made up bytho Roman hui htssor
the murderers of Caesar’ (aa a reward sor their exploit). buch a
contribution on the part of thee uites (who were the moneyed men
or capitalists of Rome) would oi course be e uivaleut to a declara·
tion that they sided with the conspirators. his use of aerarium,
which properly is ‘the public treasury.‘ is rare, if not unique; but
the epithet, privatum, renders its meaning sufficiently clear.

³ ‘Eutreated,’ ‘requested,' as occasionnlly.

⁴ ‘Without party-spirit,’ ‘without publicly siding with any party.’
It is evident that Atticus was a very timid man, anxious to keep
peace with all parties.

'colloqui is ‘to converse upon,' ‘discuss3' coire, ‘to hevea
(formal) conierence! The absence of a ⁶ but¹ (sed or ot) at the be·
ginning ol' this clause gives strength.

⁸ M. Antonius. a friend oi Caesar, and a man of taient and ener y,
butun unprincipled profligate, became by iutrigue, u shcrt timendos
his patron's murder, the most powerlnl man rn Rome, trll young Qc·
tavianus, afterwards called Augustus, Julius Caesar's grand-nephew,
cameto the city, and contrived to obtain the good-will both of the

Ι senate and of his uucle’s veteran soldiers.

¹ Namely, Antony. He had a colleague, P. Cornelius Dolabella,
son-in-law of Cicero, but Antony was iu maliti} the ruler of the state ;
hence the srngular. There seems to be a slrg t gap here, something

being required to govcrn prouinciarum: administratione ueglecto, or

simias worda, must be supplied. It is uncertain what were the
provinces mitond te'Brotns and Cassius.
