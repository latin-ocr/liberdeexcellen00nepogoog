INTRODUOTION

Vuav little is known of the personal history of Cornelius Nepos,
and the lew facts with which we are acquainted, hare been
gathered rather by inference, than from actual statemeats in
ancient writers. In his life of Atticus (19), he speaks ol his
having survived Atticus as a special dispensation of fortune.
From this, as well as from the grem intimacy which existed be-
tween the two-an intimacy of a kind scarcely consistent with
any great disparity ol age—we m'ay conclude that Nepos was
born about the same time as Atticus-109 rac. His native
district was that part of Cisalpine Gaul which the Insubrians
inhabited, beyond the Po. He removed to Rome in early life, aud
in all likelihood made that city his principa] place of residence
till his death, content with a small competence, spending his time
tc a great extent in literary pu'rsuits, in the society of literary
friends, and, both from prudence and his natural lore of peace
and tranquillity, keeping himself entirely unconnected with the
politica] morements of that stirringand eventiul epoch. We gether
from a remark in one oi Cicero’s letters to Atticus (xvi. 14, 4),
that Nepos lost a child by death about the year 44 a. a, when he
must have been considerably advanced in life. His most intimato
friends seem to have been Atticus, who was undoubtedlya man
oi very great learning, taste, amiability, and virtue, though the
sketch of his character by Nepos is drawn with the peu of an
idolator rather than an admirer; Cicero, the most eminent philos-
opher and orator that Rome ever produced; and Catullus, a poet
of very high genius, who dedicated his collected poems to our
author. The exact period of the death of Nepos is uncertain.
We know that the latter part ol the lifs of Atticus was written in
or after the year 29 rao„ because in chapter 19, Octavianus is
styled imperator, which title was not conferred on him till that
year3 and it is probable, considering Nepos’s adranced age, that
he died shortly after. His character may be very easily seen
from his writiugs, He was a man oi high moral excellence, and
hence in his biographies he constantly strives to bring the virtues
ol his heroes into prominent view, considering their exploits in
, war as bnt of secondary interest. His moral observatione are
almost always just, and often very beautiful. ln intellectual
power he was merely respectable, not eminent; and a conscious-

. nass olltpis was probably one meson why he never epged the
